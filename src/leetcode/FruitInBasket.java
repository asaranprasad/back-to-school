// **Problem**
// "Start from any index, we can collect at most two types of fruits. What is the maximum amount"

// **Translation**
// Find out the longest length of subarrays with at most 2 different numbers?

// **Explanation:**
// Loop all fruit c in tree,
// Note that a and b are the last two different types of fruit that we met,
// c is the current fruit type,
// so it's something like "....aaabbbc..."

// **Case 1 c == b:**
// fruit c already in the basket,
// and it's same as the last type of fruit
// cur += 1
// count_b += 1

// **Case 2 c == a:**
// fruit c already in the basket,
// but it's not same as the last type of fruit
// cur += 1
// count_b = 1
// a = b, b = c

// **Case 3 c != b && c!= a:**
// fruit c not in the basket,
// cur = count_b + 1
// count_b = 1
// a = b, b = c

// Of course, in each turn we need to update res = max(res, cur)

// **Complexity:**
// O(N) time, O(1) space
